CNN Classification of Dogs and Cats
This repository contains the code and report for the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) project focused on classifying images as either a cat or a dog.

1. Installations
The project was implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook. Below are the main libraries and tools used:

TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the CNN.
pandas: For data manipulation.
numpy: For numerical operations.
matplotlib: For visualizing results.
scikit-learn: For evaluation metrics.

2. Project Motivation
The primary objective of this project is to:

Build a deep learning model to classify images as either a cat or a dog.
Demonstrate the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in solving image classification problems.
Address challenges like overfitting and computational complexity in training deep learning models.
This project showcases the practical applications of CNNs and their potential in computer vision tasks.

3. File Descriptions
This repository contains the following files:

cnn_dog_cat_classification.ipynb: The main notebook with code and results.
Training, validation, and test datasets: Sourced from Kaggle’s Cats and Dogs dataset, used for building and evaluating the model.

4. Results
After training the CNN for 25 epochs, the model achieved:

Test Accuracy: 83%
The results demonstrate the model’s robust performance in distinguishing between cats and dogs. Balanced accuracy was observed across both classes, with minimal misclassifications.
